# My Locations

This project will display on the web different places in the Seattle area that I have been, as well as having
an animated marker to display where I am living currently. Click option for more details about what I've done or experienced at these specific markers.


	will make it much more sophisticated later
	just working out details with Google Maps API



# Other Features I plan to add:
- mark locations where I want to travel too
- other misc locations
- locations will have little informations when you click on them (done)

# Above and Beyond Features!!! :
- make into mobile app, so people can keep track of their location histories
- be able to add what they did etc. like a little locations blog
